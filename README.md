# the-homerow

The home for @homerow_j. This is my _Net Cave_ where I write and comment on things that interest me. Such as ending the Fed. It is also a repo for me to store data for day trading, knowledge, posterity.

This repo acting as a website is organized as a _folder-file_ structure composed of Markdown files in lieu of HTML pages. It is a simple, future proof, and efficient way to deal with the obfuscation of modern web "design" using the built-in features of GitHubesque services.
