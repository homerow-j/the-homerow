## Introduction

The home for @homerow_j. This is my _Net Cave_ where I muse on things and roam my landscape. It is also a repo for me to store data for knowledge and posterity.

This repo acting as a website is organized as a _folder-file_ structure composed of Markdown files in lieu of HTML pages. It is a simple, future proof, and efficient way to deal with the obfuscation of modern web "design" using the built-in features of GitHubesque services.

## Folder Descriptions

* **Data** - _mostly market data but being a collector of bits and bytes other collections will find their way there_.
* **Musings** - _my commentary_.
* **Source** -_various scripts and code_.
